Hi! My name is Natalia and I'm a software test engineer. I like fixing things before they are broken. Being curious about many things, I try to keep my focus only on a few at a time. Below is a snapshot of what they are currently.

### Here is some of my recent work

Publications for TrueCar tech blog on building the test automation for CI/CD

### Currently learning

React with Wes Bos https://reactforbeginners.com/ and https://advancedreact.com/

### My favorite recent reads on software development and testing

Humans vs Computers by Gojko Adzic[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36118272-humans-vs-computers] - fun collection of software design and implementation errors and the impact they could have on someone's lives.

By the way, when I'm not in front of a computer or reading a book, I'm either running somewhere on the trails, or doing some fine joga. Or travelling. Or camping. Or mountain biking. Or cooking! Anyways, you got the idea :)

Thanks for checking out my profile!
